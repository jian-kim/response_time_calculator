# Response Time Calculator
Project for the 2017 SRC Hackathon, details for this event can be found at https://hack-src-2017.devpost.com/

The Response Time Calculator takes an address as input, and outputs the location of the nearest emergency service with the worst-case response time taking into account traffic conditions.

This is done by taking several datasets containing the addresses of fire stations and hospitals in the United States and utilizing the google maps API to calculate the driving distances between the relevant locations. This is done using Python.
